# VP-022: `hook_paths()` Returns Exactly 5 Entries — One per `HookType` Variant

> **One-per-file:** Each verification property lives in its own file.
> Renumbered from VP-ENGINE-003 (PG-5 historical) per template-compliance Dispatch 5b.

## Property Statement

`ClaudeCodeModule::hook_paths()` returns a structure containing exactly
5 entries, one per `HookType` variant. The path strings are exactly:

| HookType variant | Path |
|------------------|------|
| `SessionStart` | `/hooks/session-start` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `/hooks/prompt-submit` |
| `PreToolUse` | `/hooks/pre-tool-use` |
| `Notification` | `/hooks/notification` |
| `Stop` | `/hooks/stop` |

## Source Contract

- **BC:** BC-2.03.004 — `ClaudeCodeModule` Inherent Methods
  (`hook_paths()` 5-Entry Canonical Set).
- **Postcondition/Invariant:** BC-2.03.004 §Postconditions asserting
  `hook_paths()` returns exactly 5 entries with the exact path strings
  per the canonical `HookType` variant → path mapping; `spawn()` and
  `preflight()` remain inherent methods (NOT trait methods); ABI
  versioning via `monocle_core::MONOCLE_ABI_VERSION` const (cross-property
  with VP-012), NOT via a trait method.
- **Traces to (historical):** BC-ENGINE-003 (SS-engine-module.md
  §Struct-level inherent operations; PRD v1.25 §BC-ENGINE-003 Verification
  subsection).

## Proof Method

| Method | Tool | Bounded? | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Integration test (primary) | cargo test | Bounded — 5-variant exhaustive match | Length assertion + per-variant exhaustive path-string match; orthogonal source-grep against `monocle-core/src/engine.rs` to confirm `spawn()` / `preflight()` are NOT on the `EngineModule` trait |

## Mechanism

Integration test (harness located at
`monocle-runtime/tests/engine_module_claude_methods.rs` — files in
`<crate>/tests/` are cargo integration tests; PRD v1.25 §7 RTM Test Type
column labels this BC `Unit` referring to conceptual scope, but the
harness layout is cargo-integration per file location). The harness
asserts `module.hook_paths().len() == 5`, exhaustively matches each
`HookType` variant to verify path-string equality with the canonical
table, and runs an orthogonal source-grep against
`monocle-core/src/engine.rs` to confirm `spawn()` and `preflight()` are
NOT declared as trait methods.

## Pre-conditions

- `ClaudeCodeModule::new("http://127.0.0.1:7891".into())` constructs a
  module.
- `HookType` is the canonical 5-variant enum from
  `monocle_core::HookType`.

## Post-conditions

1. `module.hook_paths().len() == 5`.
2. For each `HookType` variant `v`, `module.hook_paths().get(&v)`
   returns `Some(&"/hooks/...".to_string())` matching the table above
   exactly.
3. No extra variants exist (the `match` over `HookType` is exhaustive
   in the harness — adding a 6th variant would fail to compile, which
   is the correct propagation given `#[non_exhaustive]` on `HookType` is
   for external consumers; the trait implementer (this crate) is
   internal and so `HookType` exhaustive matching is valid here).

## Counter-examples

1. `hook_paths()` returns 4 entries (missing one) — fails
   post-condition 1.
2. A path is typoed (`/hooks/pre_tool_use` with underscore instead of
   hyphen) — fails the exact-string match.
3. A new variant added to `HookType` (e.g., `PostToolUse`) without
   updating `hook_paths()` — the exhaustive match in the harness fails
   to compile, forcing the implementer to update.
4. `spawn()` or `preflight()` are accidentally moved into the
   `EngineModule` trait (they MUST remain inherent methods on
   `ClaudeCodeModule`) — fails an orthogonal source-grep check against
   `monocle-core/src/engine.rs`.
5. The ABI version is read via a trait method (e.g., `module.abi_version()`)
   instead of `monocle_core::MONOCLE_ABI_VERSION` const — fails an
   orthogonal source-grep check (cross-property with VP-012).

## Probe Matrix

| Probe | Setup | Expected outcome |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 22.a | `module.hook_paths().len()` | `== 5` |
| 22.b | Exhaustive `match v { SessionStart => "/hooks/session-start", ... }` for all 5 variants | Each variant maps to the exact canonical path string |
| 22.c | Source-grep `monocle-core/src/engine.rs` for `fn spawn(` or `fn preflight(` inside `trait EngineModule { ... }` | No match — inherent methods only |
| 22.d | Source-grep `monocle-core/src/engine.rs` for `fn abi_version(` inside `trait EngineModule { ... }` | No match — ABI is the `MONOCLE_ABI_VERSION` const (cross-VP-012) |
| 22.e | Mutation: typo `/hooks/pre_tool_use` (underscore) | Probe 22.b fails string equality |
| 22.f | Mutation: add 6th `HookType` variant `PostToolUse` without updating `hook_paths()` | Exhaustive match in harness fails to compile |

## Harness Location

- `monocle-runtime/tests/engine_module_claude_methods.rs` (integration test)
- Test name: `test_BC_ENGINE_003_claude_module_hook_paths_five_entries`
  (per PRD v1.25 §BC-ENGINE-003, Verification subsection — hybrid name
  adjudicated by product-owner combining `claude_module` (concrete
  struct under test, not the trait), `hook_paths` (the inherent
  method), and `five_entries` (the count assertion); see PRD v1.2
  §Trace v1.2 for the adjudication reasoning. To be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_03_004_claude_module_hook_paths_five_entries` post BC
  renumber propagation into source).

## Proof Harness Skeleton

Per L4 template §Proof Harness Skeleton: the canonical proof-harness intent for
this VP is documented across `## Mechanism` (execution narrative — what the
harness does), `## Pre-conditions` / `## Post-conditions` (assertion surface),
`## Counter-examples` (negative cases), `## Probe Matrix` (probe enumeration),
and `## Harness Location` (file path + test name). The skeleton below is the
template-strict form pointing to the rich harness specification above.

```rust
// Proof method: integration-test
// See ## Mechanism for execution narrative.
// See ## Probe Matrix for the canonical probe enumeration.
// See ## Harness Location for the implementing file and test name.
//
// Skeleton (illustrative; canonical assertions live in the probe matrix above):
#[test]  // or #[kani::proof] / proptest! / etc. per proof_method
fn verify_bc_2_03_004() {
    // Pre-conditions: see ## Pre-conditions section
    // Probe execution: see ## Probe Matrix section
    // Post-condition assertions: see ## Post-conditions section
    // Counter-example coverage: see ## Counter-examples section
}
```

**Harness implementation location:**

- `monocle-runtime/tests/engine_module_claude_methods.rs` (integration test)
- Test name: `test_BC_ENGINE_003_claude_module_hook_paths_five_entries`
  (per PRD v1.25 §BC-ENGINE-003, Verification subsection — hybrid name
  adjudicated by product-owner combining `claude_module` (concrete
  struct under test, not the trait), `hook_paths` (the inherent
  method), and `five_entries` (the count assertion); see PRD v1.2
  §Trace v1.2 for the adjudication reasoning. To be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_03_004_claude_module_hook_paths_five_entries` post BC
  renumber propagation into source).

## Feasibility Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Input space size | Bounded | Per `## Proof Method` Bounded? column above; finite probe set or bounded property quantification. |
| Proof complexity | Tractable | `proof_method: integration-test` per frontmatter; mechanism documented in `## Mechanism` section. |
| Tool support | Available | Tooling pinned in `architecture/SS-deps-pin-manifest.md`; no novel verification tooling required. |
| Estimated proof time | Within Phase-1 budget | `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter. Coverage details in `## Proof Method` table; probe enumeration in `## Probe Matrix`. |

**Authoritative feasibility verdict:** `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter (canonical machine-consumed field).

## Lifecycle

| Event | Date | Actor |
|-------|------|-------|
| Created | v1.0.0 (cycle) | vsdd-factory:architect |
| Proof harness committed | pending Phase-3 implementation | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Proof first passed | pending Phase-6 formal hardening | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Locked (VERIFIED) | pending (`verification_lock: false`) | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |

**Authoritative lifecycle state** (canonical machine-consumed fields in frontmatter):

## §Trace v1.0.1 — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template

**Bump:** v1.0 → v1.0.1.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0 (Dispatch 5a/5b commits 7326ff5 + e3824ec — VP monolith decomposition; Dispatch 7 commit 51e77cb — input-hash population).
**Scope of v1.0.1 (Option 3 hybrid — heading reconciliation; NO content removed):**

### Heading changes (NORMATIVE)

- **Renamed** `## Verification Method` → `## Proof Method` (template-strict per L4-verification-property-template.md §Proof Method). Content unchanged; identical Method/Tool/Bounded?/Coverage table preserved verbatim.
- **Added** `## Proof Harness Skeleton` (template-required §Proof Harness Skeleton). Section is a template-strict skeleton block that references the existing rich harness specification (`## Mechanism` for execution narrative, `## Probe Matrix` for probe enumeration, `## Harness Location` for file + test name). The L4 template's skeleton is a Rust code-block stub; monocle's pre-existing `## Mechanism` + `## Harness Location` exceed the template's stub fidelity by carrying execution narrative AND concrete file paths. The new `## Proof Harness Skeleton` section satisfies the template heading requirement without removing the richer Phase-1-specific content.
- **Added** `## Feasibility Assessment` (template-required §Feasibility Assessment). Section is a populated Factor/Assessment/Notes table derived from the `feasibility:` frontmatter field (canonical machine-consumed value) + the `## Proof Method` Bounded?/Coverage columns. The L4 template carries feasibility as both a frontmatter field and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter value.
- **Added** `## Lifecycle` (template-required §Lifecycle). Section is a populated Event/Date/Actor table + an authoritative lifecycle-state mirror of the DF-030 lifecycle frontmatter fields. The L4 template carries lifecycle as both frontmatter fields and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter values.

### Project-specific extensions retained (INFORMATIONAL rationale per SE-17g)

The monocle VP body retains the following sections beyond the L4 template's minimum set; they encode Phase-1-specific verification discipline that emerged during the cycle-001 adversarial review chain:

- `## Mechanism` — execution narrative for the proof harness. Encodes the F-R88-5 discipline of separating test-type-class (Integration/Unit/AST-audit/Proptest) from harness-execution-narrative. Without this section the harness intent reduces to a one-cell `Method` column in `## Proof Method`, which proved insufficient during R85-R87 for adversary fresh-context comprehension.
- `## Pre-conditions` — precondition surface for the harness. Required for proof-harness reproducibility per F-R89/F-R90 work.
- `## Post-conditions` — assertion surface for the harness. The numbered postcondition format (1., 2., 3., …) emerged from R88-R91 BC↔VP round-trip discipline; flat unstructured postcondition prose proved insufficient for fresh-context BC→VP traceability.
- `## Counter-examples` — negative cases. Encodes mutation-test rationale per VP-013's `## Mutation-Test Rationale` extension; even VPs without an explicit mutation block carry counter-example enumeration to make the assertion surface adversary-reviewable.
- `## Probe Matrix` — probe enumeration table. The Probe ID column (e.g., `1.a`, `14.b`, `22.c`) provides direct probe→assertion traceability for the F-R89/F-R90 probe-enumeration discipline that emerged from BC↔VP round-trip cycles. Without this section the probe set is implicit in `## Mechanism` prose, which the adversary repeatedly flagged as insufficient.
- `## Harness Location` — direct test-path traceability (file path + test name). Provides implementer + test-writer agents in Phase 3 with explicit harness implementation targets, eliminating one round-trip during TDD red-gate setup.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **L4 template:** `templates/L4-verification-property-template.md` (canonical heading set: `## Property Statement`, `## Source Contract`, `## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`).
- **Audit R1:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r1.md` (D-122 trigger — initial heading-name mismatch identification).
- **Audit R2:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r2.md` RES-03 (residual heading-name mismatch on all 22 VP files; this v1.0.1 closes RES-03).

### Concurrent dispatches

- **architect RES-01+RES-04:** COMPLETE (commit 0af206a) — input-hash normalization + ARCH-INDEX Tokens column.
- **PO RES-02+RES-05:** COMPLETE (commit 1a09095) — BC VP anchor sweep + PRD §6/§7 column reconciliation.
- **FV RES-03:** this v1.0.1 (audit R2 residual closure for all 22 VP files).

### Content preservation verification

NO content removed. Heading renames in place. New `## Proof Harness Skeleton` / `## Feasibility Assessment` / `## Lifecycle` sections are derived from existing frontmatter fields + existing body sections; they add structure without changing the authoritative machine-consumed values (which remain in frontmatter per the L4 schema).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T18:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T17:30:00Z` (PRD v1.26.1 — RES-05 concurrent dispatch). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: heading renames + new section additions (`## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`); frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: project-specific extension rationale (above subsection); audit cross-references; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Chose **Option 3 (hybrid)** — template-aligned form with documented project-specific extensions — over Option 1 (template-strict rename + reorganize, which would risk content drift on the Phase-1-emergent probe enumeration discipline) and Option 2 (extension-only documentation without template heading adoption, which would leave the audit RES-03 WARN unresolved). Option 3 satisfies the L4 template heading requirements (all 6 required headings present) AND preserves the Phase-1 verification discipline (probe matrices, mechanism narratives, harness locations) that the adversarial review chain hardened.

## §Trace v1.0.2 — F-R105-13 LOW: VP §References PRD Citation Refresh v1.26 → v1.26.3

**Bump:** v1.0.1 → v1.0.2.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.1 (commit 4090d0b — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template).
**Scope of v1.0.2 (NORMATIVE — §References PRD citation refresh; NO content cascade; NO BC-path changes — BC §References already cite canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-NN/BC-2.SS.NNN.md` paths):**

### Change set 1 — §References PRD Citation Refresh `v1.26` → `v1.26.3` (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** §References cited `prd.md v1.26 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65).` (pre-edit grep).
  - **After:** §References cites `prd.md v1.26.3 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.3 in F-R105-12 closure, parallel PO commit b2b378b).` (post-edit grep).
- **SE-17c-d body-scope grep:** post-edit `grep -n "prd.md v1.26 " vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` → 0 matches; `grep -n "prd.md v1.26.3" vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` → 1 match (§References line).
- **BC §References scope:** §References §Source contract entry already cites canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md` (per BC-INDEX.md v1.2). No BC-path changes required in this dispatch.
- **Historical PRD v1.25 citations in body prose (Source Contract `Traces to (historical)`, Harness Location `to be migrated to`, Proof Harness Skeleton `to be migrated to`, where present):** UNCHANGED — these are explicitly historical predecessor citations pinned to the pre-Dispatch-4 PRD monolith and must not be refreshed.

### Rationale

PO commit b2b378b (T-128k Round-3 PO dispatch) bumped PRD `v1.26.2 → v1.26.3` for F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure. Parallel FV dispatch refreshes VP §References to cite the post-bump PRD version, preserving the stale-citation-zero invariant established in F-R105-7 (manifest pin refresh) and F-R105-11 (sister-VP reference reconciliation). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1: no MVP-driven deferral; mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope of T-128k FV portion rather than left to post-Round-3 cleanup.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.3 (commit b2b378b — F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.2 (commit 61133a7 — confirms canonical sharded path `ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md` for BC-2.03.004).
- **R105 closure chain:** F-R105-13 LOW — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh sweep.
- **Concurrent dispatches (T-128k Round 3):**
  - PO: PRD v1.26.2 → v1.26.3 (F-R105-12 + GAP-R44-4) — COMPLETE (commit b2b378b).
  - architect: auth-header interop adjudication — separate scope.
  - BA: L2-INDEX anchor fixes — separate scope.
  - FV: this §Trace (F-R105-13 — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T20:30:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T19:30:00Z` (this VP's prior v1.0.1 §Trace and PRD v1.26.3 frontmatter). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References PRD citation `v1.26` → `v1.26.3`; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### SE-17g META audit (NORMATIVE)

Sweep-wide post-edit re-grep across all 22 VP files: `grep -rE "prd\.md v1\.(26[^.]|26\.[012])(\s|\$)" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. Sweep-wide re-grep for non-sharded BC paths: `grep -rE "behavioral-contracts/BC-[^I]" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. F-R105-13 closure verified.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope rather than deferred. PRD v1.26.3 cite is valid as of PO commit b2b378b. No tech-debt entries created. Body-prose historical PRD v1.25 citations preserved unchanged per Production-Grade discipline (historical predecessor citations are not stale; refreshing them would erase audit trail).

## §Trace v1.0.3 — F-R107-4 HIGH + GAP-R46-1 HIGH + F-R107-8 (part 2): VP §References PRD Cite Refresh v1.26.3 → v1.26.5 + Active BC-INDEX Cite Addition v1.5

**Bump:** v1.0.2 → v1.0.3.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.2 (commits 932f4e0 / 7b8d6e8 — prior R105/R106 FV sweeps).
**Scope of v1.0.3 (NORMATIVE — mechanical §References citation refresh + active BC-INDEX cite addition; NO content cascade):**

### Change set 1 — §References PRD Citation Refresh `v1.26.3` → `v1.26.5` (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** §References cited `prd.md v1.26.3 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.3 in F-R105-12 closure, parallel PO commit b2b378b).` (pre-edit grep).
  - **After:** §References cites `prd.md v1.26.5 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.5 in F-R107-3 / GAP-R46-1 closure, parallel PO 6B dispatch — commit pending; supersedes v1.26.4 commit 01af634 pre-R107 fix burst + v1.26.3 commit b2b378b F-R105-12 closure).` (post-edit grep).
- **SE-17c-d body-scope grep (active §References scope):** post-edit `grep -nE "prd\.md.* v1\.26\.[0-4]" vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` outside §Trace history blocks → 0 matches; `grep -n "prd.md\` v1.26.5" vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` outside §Trace history blocks → 1 match (§References PRD line).
- **Historical PRD citations in §Trace history blocks:** UNCHANGED per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation discipline (predecessor citations document state-at-the-time of each historical bump and must not be refreshed; refreshing them would erase audit trail).

### Change set 2 — §References Active BC-INDEX Cite Addition v1.5 (NORMATIVE)

- **Rationale for active-cite ADDITION (not §Trace history rewrite):** F-R107-8 part 2 identifies stale BC-INDEX v1.2 cites in 22 VPs' `BC §References scope` evidence text inside §Trace v1.0.3 (F-R105-13 history blocks). Per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation discipline, §Trace history blocks are append-only — they document state at the time of the bump and are immutable. The production-grade closure is to ADD an active §References BC-INDEX cite at the current v1.5 target, which makes the v1.5 cite live-authoritative and demotes the v1.2 mention in §Trace v1.0.3 to historical snapshot evidence (its correct semantic). Before this dispatch, no VP had an active BC-INDEX §References cite — the only BC-INDEX version mentions were in §Trace history. Adding the active cite closes F-R107-8 part 2 durably without violating SE-17g.
- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** active §References had no `BC index:` line (only `Source contract:` cited the sharded BC path without referencing BC-INDEX version). Pre-edit grep `grep -nE "BC-INDEX" vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` outside §Trace blocks → 0 matches.
  - **After:** active §References gained `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.5 (commit pending — PO 6A R107 Round 6A finalization; supersedes v1.4 commit bb088a2 — PO 5A R106 Round 5; supersedes v1.2 commit 61133a7 — F-R105-3 + F-R105-9 + OBS-R44-1 DI mapping closure).` Post-edit grep `grep -nE "BC-INDEX\.md.* v1\.5" vp-022-claude-code-module-inherent-methods.md` outside §Trace blocks → 1 match (§References BC index line).
- **No BC-path or BC-version changes required:** §Source contract entry already cites canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md` (per BC-INDEX.md v1.5 confirmation). No BC-path edits in this dispatch.

### Rationale

R107 Round 6C (FV scope) closes three findings in coordinated parallel dispatch:

- **F-R107-4 HIGH (VP-009-specific):** VP-009 cited ADR-0005 v1.0.1 in 3 locations (§Source Contract line 89; active §References line 431; §Trace v1.0.4 Authoritative cross-references line 660). Current ADR-0005 is at v1.0.2 (frontmatter `version: "1.0.2"` confirmed at audit time; commit 03a4c57 — F-R106-14 ADR-0005 inputs path normalization + F-R106-7 F-FC-I005 fabrication removal). All 3 cites refreshed to v1.0.2 in this dispatch.
- **GAP-R46-1 HIGH (all-22-VPs):** VP-INDEX was pre-fixed in commit 01af634 (PRD pin v1.26.3 → v1.26.4 pre-R107 fix burst) but the 22 individual VP files' active §References still cited the stale v1.26.3. PO 6B is bumping PRD v1.26.4 → v1.26.5 in parallel; this FV dispatch refreshes all 22 VPs' active §References to the post-PO-6B v1.26.5 target.
- **F-R107-8 part 2 (all-22-VPs):** 22 VPs had stale BC-INDEX v1.2 mentions inside §Trace v1.0.3 history blocks. Per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation, those §Trace mentions are historical snapshots and must not be edited. The durable closure is to ADD active §References BC-INDEX cites at the current v1.5 target (post-PO-6A), making v1.5 the live-authoritative cite and demoting the v1.2 mentions in §Trace v1.0.3 to historical snapshot evidence (their correct SE-17g semantic). PO 6A is bumping BC-INDEX v1.4 → v1.5 in parallel; this FV dispatch targets the post-PO-6A v1.5 version.

Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5: mechanical citation refresh + durable cite addition executed in-scope of R107 Round 6C rather than deferred. No tech-debt entries created. Historical §Trace block citations preserved unchanged per SE-17g.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.5 (commit d92e4a7 — PO 6B R107 Round 6B PRD + supplements dispatch [co-mingled with PO 6A]; supersedes v1.26.4 commit 01af634 pre-R107 fix burst).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.5 (commit d92e4a7 — PO 6A R107 Round 6A BC scope dispatch [co-mingled with PO 6B]; supersedes v1.4 commit bb088a2 — PO 5A R106 Round 5 BC-INDEX dual-accept finalization).
- **R107 closure chain:** F-R107-4 HIGH (VP-009 ADR-0005 pin refresh — VP-009-only); GAP-R46-1 HIGH (22-VP PRD cite refresh sweep); F-R107-8 part 2 (22-VP active BC-INDEX cite addition).
- **Concurrent dispatches (R107 Round 6):**
  - PO 6A: BC + BC-INDEX scope (BC-INDEX v1.4 → v1.5) — separate scope.
  - PO 6B: PRD + supplements (PRD v1.26.4 → v1.26.5) — separate scope.
  - FV 6C: this dispatch (VP-009 ADR-0005 pin refresh + 22-VP PRD cite refresh + 22-VP BC-INDEX active cite addition + VP-INDEX cascade).
  - Architect 6D: SS-forward-compatibility scope — separate scope.
  - BA 6E: L2-INDEX scope — separate scope.

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T23:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T22:50:00Z` (VP-INDEX v1.4 timestamp; pre-R107 fix burst commit 01af634). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References PRD citation `v1.26.3` → `v1.26.5`; §References BC index cite ADDITION at v1.5; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Mechanical citation refresh + durable cite-addition executed in-scope rather than deferred. PRD v1.26.5 cite is the post-PO-6B target (commit pending — will resolve to concrete SHA during final state-manager pass after parallel dispatches converge). BC-INDEX v1.5 cite is the post-PO-6A target (commit pending — same resolution). No tech-debt entries created. §Trace history blocks preserved unchanged per SE-17g — historical predecessor citations are not stale; refreshing them would erase audit trail.

## §Trace v1.0.4 — F-R108-5 HIGH + F-R108-6 HIGH + F-R108-15 MED: R108 Round 7D FV Cascade (commit-pending Resolution + SS Pin Refresh + Active R7-Forward Cite Refresh)

**Bump:** v1.0.3 → v1.0.4.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.3 (commit bd14774 — F-R107 Round 6C FV — 22-VP PRD cite refresh + 22-VP BC-INDEX active cite + VP-009 ADR-0005 pin refresh + VP-INDEX cascade).
**Scope of v1.0.4 (NORMATIVE — R108 Round 7D 3-fix coordinated cascade in parallel dispatch with PO 7A BC + PO 7B PRD/supplements + Architect 7C SS-pin-stable):**

### Change 1 — F-R108-5 + F-R108-6 HIGH: §References Active Cite Refresh to R7-Forward Targets + Historical Placeholder Resolution (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f §References BC index line:** active cite refreshed from `v1.5 (commit pending — PO 6A R107 Round 6A finalization)` to `v1.6 (commit pending — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; supersedes v1.5 commit d92e4a7 — PO 6A R107 Round 6A finalization)`. The historical R107 "commit pending" annotation resolves to d92e4a7 (PO 6A + 6B co-mingled per Round 6F SM message); the new active cite carries an R108 Round 7A forward-coordination placeholder (will resolve during R108 Round 7E SM pass).
- **SE-17f §References PRD line:** active cite refreshed from `v1.26.5 §BC-2.03.004 (... parallel PO 6B dispatch — commit pending)` to `v1.26.6 §BC-2.03.004 (... R108 Round 7B PO dispatch — commit pending; supersedes v1.26.5 in F-R107-3 / GAP-R46-1 closure commit d92e4a7)`. Same two-step pattern: R107 placeholder resolves to d92e4a7; new R108 Round 7B forward placeholder for v1.26.6 target.
- **SE-17f §Trace v1.0.4 Authoritative cross-references Architecture line:** historical placeholder `v1.0.30 (commit pending — architect 5E dispatch)` resolved in-place to `v1.0.30 (commit 03a4c57 — architect 5E dispatch; subsequently bumped to v1.0.31 by architect 6D commit 98396fe)`. Per SE-17g, this is a historical cross-references block (NOT an SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot) — refreshing to resolve a now-known SHA is permitted because it describes the target artifact's actual lineage, not a state-at-time-of-bump snapshot.
- **SE-17f §Trace v1.0.5 Authoritative cross-references PRD + BC-INDEX lines:** historical placeholders resolved to commit d92e4a7 (PO 6A + 6B co-mingled).

### Change 3 — F-R108-15 MED: §References Architecture Active Cite Refresh (NORMATIVE, SS-01 VPs only)

(See Change 2 above for SS-01 VPs. SS-02 / SS-03 VPs do not carry an SS-NN pin in §References and require no architecture-line cascade in this dispatch — pin sweep deferred to the dependent architecture file's next direct cite cascade.)

### Rationale

R108 Round 7D (FV scope) closes three findings in coordinated parallel dispatch with PO 7A (BC) + PO 7B (PRD/supplements) + Architect 7C (SS-pin-stable):

- **F-R108-5 HIGH (VP-INDEX):** VP-INDEX §References `commit pending` placeholders unresolved (R107 R6A/6B targets). Resolved to d92e4a7 (PO 6A + 6B co-mingled commit per Round 6F SM message). New active cite advances to R108 Round 7A BC-INDEX v1.6 + R108 Round 7B PRD v1.26.6 targets with explicit forward-coordination "commit pending" annotation (will resolve during R108 Round 7E SM pass).
- **F-R108-6 HIGH (all-22-VPs):** 22 VPs carried ~214 cumulative `commit pending` placeholders across active §References + §Trace v1.0.4 / v1.0.5 Authoritative cross-references blocks. Active §References refreshed to R108 Round 7 forward targets (BC-INDEX v1.6 + PRD v1.26.6) with explicit forward-coordination annotations. Historical Authoritative cross-references blocks resolved to concrete SHAs (d92e4a7 + 03a4c57 + 98396fe). SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence preserved per SE-17g (historical state-at-time-of-bump snapshots are immutable; refreshing them would falsify the audit trail).
- **F-R108-15 MED (SS-01 VPs only):** 10 SS-01 VPs cite SS-daemon-lifecycle v1.0.30 in active §References. Architect 6D bumped SS-daemon-lifecycle v1.0.30 → v1.0.31 in commit 98396fe; Architect 7C (parallel R108 Round 7C) keeps SS-daemon-lifecycle at v1.0.31 per coordination directive. SS-01 VP active §References refreshed to v1.0.31 with concrete commit 98396fe; SS-01 §Source Contract Traces-to historical-block cites also refreshed to v1.0.31 (these are body sections, not §Trace history, so SE-17g permits in-place refresh).

Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5: mechanical citation refresh + pin sweep executed in-scope of R108 Round 7D rather than deferred. No tech-debt entries created. SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence in prior §Trace blocks preserved per SE-17g.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.6 (commit pending — PO 7B R108 Round 7B PRD + supplements dispatch; supersedes v1.26.5 commit d92e4a7).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.6 (commit pending — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; supersedes v1.5 commit d92e4a7).
- **Architecture (SS-01):** `architecture/SS-daemon-lifecycle.md` v1.0.31 (commit 98396fe — Architect 6D; Architect 7C keeps at v1.0.31).
- **R108 closure chain:** F-R108-5 HIGH (VP-INDEX commit-pending resolution — handled in VP-INDEX v1.6 cascade); F-R108-6 HIGH (22-VP commit-pending sweep); F-R108-15 MED (SS pin sweep — SS-01 VPs only).
- **Concurrent dispatches (R108 Round 7):**
  - PO 7A: BC + BC-INDEX scope (BC-INDEX v1.5 → v1.6) — separate scope.
  - PO 7B: PRD + supplements (PRD v1.26.5 → v1.26.6) — separate scope.
  - Architect 7C: arch — keeps current SS versions per coordination — separate scope.
  - FV 7D: this dispatch (22-VP commit-pending sweep + 10-VP SS pin v1.0.31 + VP-009 probe renumber + VP-INDEX v1.6 cascade — THIS file).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-18T01:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T23:30:00Z` (R107 Round 6F SM commit timestamp). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References BC index cite refresh `v1.5` → `v1.6` (with R7-forward placeholder); §References PRD cite refresh `v1.26.5` → `v1.26.6` (with R7-forward placeholder); §References Architecture cite refresh `v1.0.30` → `v1.0.31` (SS-01 VPs only); §Source Contract Traces-to body cite refresh `v1.0.30` → `v1.0.31` (SS-01 VPs only); §Trace v1.0.4 + v1.0.5 Authoritative cross-references historical placeholder resolution; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+4+5

Rule 1: mechanical citation refresh + pin sweep executed in-scope rather than deferred. Rule 4: 3 coupled cascade fixes consolidated into single v1.0.4 bump rather than fragmented. Rule 5: cheapest path (defer pin refresh as "stale by 1 minor version, acceptable") rejected in favor of correct path (refresh all active cites to current canonical versions). PRD v1.26.6 and BC-INDEX v1.6 cites are post-PO-7A and post-PO-7B targets (commit pending — will resolve to concrete SHAs during R108 Round 7E SM pass after parallel dispatches converge). No tech-debt entries created. SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence in prior §Trace v1.0.4 / v1.0.5 blocks preserved per SE-17g audit-trail discipline — historical state-at-time-of-bump snapshots are immutable; refreshing them would erase audit trail.

## §Trace v1.0.5 — F-R109-15 MED + F-R109-18 MED: R109 Round 8C FV Cascade (commit-pending SHA Resolution + Active Cite Forward Refresh)

**Bump:** v1.0.4 → v1.0.5.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.4 (commit 6436da7 — F-R108 Round 7D FV — 22-VP input-hash cascade).
**Scope of v1.0.5 (NORMATIVE — 2-fix coordinated cascade in R109 Round 8C FV parallel dispatch with Architect 8A SS pin bump + PO 8B BC/PRD/supplements/brief refresh):**

### Change 1 — F-R109-15 MED: §References BC-INDEX commit-pending SHA Resolution (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f §References BC-INDEX line:**
  - Before: `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.6 (commit pending — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; ...).`
  - After: `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.6 (commit 22579ac — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; ...).`
- **Rationale:** R108 Round 7 `commit pending` placeholder (active BC-INDEX v1.6 cite) resolved to concrete SHA `22579ac` (PO 7A landed in commit 22579ac per `git log --oneline -- specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` 2026-05-18T05:00:00Z). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1+4: mechanical SHA resolution executed in-scope rather than deferred.

### Change 2 — F-R109-15 MED + F-R109-18 MED: §References PRD commit-pending SHA Resolution (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f §References PRD line:**
  - Before: `PRD: \`.factory/specs/prd.md\` v1.26.6 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.6 in R108 Round 7B PO dispatch — commit pending; ...).`
  - After: `PRD: \`.factory/specs/prd.md\` v1.26.6 §BC-2.03.004 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.6 in R108 Round 7B PO dispatch commit c307f2a; ...).`
- **Rationale:** R108 Round 7 `commit pending` placeholder (active PRD v1.26.6 cite) resolved to concrete SHA `c307f2a` (PO 7B landed in commit c307f2a per `git log --oneline -- specs/prd.md` 2026-05-18T05:00:00Z). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1+4: mechanical SHA resolution executed in-scope rather than deferred.

### SE-17c-d body-scope grep (NORMATIVE)

- Post-edit `grep -n "commit pending" <this-vp-file>` body-scope active §References → 0 matches (R108 placeholders resolved; no SS pins to refresh in this VP).
- Post-edit `grep -n "commit 22579ac" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1 match (active §References BC-INDEX line).
- Post-edit `grep -n "commit c307f2a" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1 match (active §References PRD line).

### Authoritative cross-references

- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.6 (commit 22579ac — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch).
- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.6 (commit c307f2a — PO 7B R108 Round 7B PRD + supplements dispatch).

- **R109 closure chain:** F-R109-15 MED (commit-pending SHA resolution) + F-R109-18 MED (commit-pending residuals).
- **Concurrent dispatches (R109 Round 8):**
  - Architect 8A: SS pin bumps v1.0.31→v1.0.32 / v1.2.12→v1.2.13 / v1.1.19→v1.1.20 — separate scope.
  - PO 8B: BC + supplements + PRD + brief refresh — separate scope.
  - FV 8C: this dispatch (22-VP cascade + VP-INDEX v1.7 — THIS file).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-18T01:30:00Z`. SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References BC-INDEX `commit pending` → `commit 22579ac`; §References PRD `commit pending` → `commit c307f2a`; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsections; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+4+5

Rule 1: mechanical citation refresh + SHA resolution executed in-scope of R109 Round 8C rather than deferred. Rule 4: 2 coupled cascade fixes consolidated into single v1.0.5 bump rather than fragmented. Rule 5: cheapest path (defer SHA resolution as "stale by 1 dispatch, acceptable") rejected in favor of correct path (resolve all R108 placeholders to concrete SHAs in scope).  No tech-debt entries created. SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence in prior §Trace blocks preserved per SE-17g audit-trail discipline.

## §Trace v1.0.6 — F-R110-1 CRIT + F-R110-3 CRIT + F-R110-10 MED + F-R110-8 HIGH (SS-03 cross-SS pin symmetry — this VP): R110 Round 9C FV Cascade (Round 8 Timestamp Correction + Active Cite Forward Refresh to BC-INDEX v1.8 + PRD v1.26.8 + SS-03 SS Pin Addition)

**Bump:** v1.0.5 → v1.0.6.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.5 (commit pending — F-R109 Round 8C FV cascade: commit-pending SHA resolution + 22-VP cascade).
**Scope of v1.0.6 (NORMATIVE — coordinated cascade in R110 Round 9C FV parallel dispatch with Architect 9A keeps + PO 9B BC/PRD/supplements/brief refresh + BA 9D):**

### Change 1 — F-R110-1 CRIT: §Trace v1.0.5 Round 8C Timestamp Correction (NORMATIVE; SE-17g EXCEPTION)

- **SE-17f §Trace v1.0.5 body timestamps:** all `2026-05-18T02:30:00Z` references in §Trace v1.0.5 (Round 8C) narrative refreshed in-place to `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` to correct the wrong-date timestamp and preserve SE-16d monotonicity for §Trace v1.0.6.
- **Rationale:** R109 Round 8C dispatch stamped `2026-05-18T02:30:00Z` was determined post-hoc to carry a wrong real-world wall-clock date. R110 Round 9C corrects in-place per user direction (R110 FAIL Option A): "Round 8 timestamps WRONG date — Round 9 fixes to 2026-05-18T05:00:00Z+ for monotonicity." SE-17g exception granted because the historical timestamp is a wrong-date defect (not a valid state-at-time-of-bump snapshot). Frontmatter `timestamp` also bumped to `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z`.

### Change 2 — F-R110-3 CRIT: §References Active BC-INDEX + PRD Forward Cite Refresh (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f §References BC-INDEX line:**
  - Before: `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.6 (commit 22579ac — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; ...).`
  - After: `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.8 (commit pending — PO 9B R110 Round 9B BC scope dispatch; supersedes v1.7 commit 517c7ee — F-R109 Round 8B PO sweep; supersedes v1.6 commit 22579ac — PO 7A R108 Round 7A BC scope dispatch; ...).`
- **SE-17f §References PRD line:**
  - Before: `PRD: \`.factory/specs/prd.md\` v1.26.6 §BC-2.03.004 (... R108 Round 7B PO dispatch commit c307f2a; ...).`
  - After: `PRD: \`.factory/specs/prd.md\` v1.26.8 §BC-2.03.004 (... R110 Round 9B PO dispatch — commit pending; supersedes v1.26.7 in F-R109 Round 8B PO sweep commit 517c7ee; supersedes v1.26.6 in R108 Round 7B PO dispatch commit c307f2a; ...).`
- **SE-17f §References Architecture line (NEW pin addition; F-R110-8 HIGH):**
  - Before: `Architecture: \`architecture/SS-engine-module.md\` §<section>.` (no version pin)
  - After: `Architecture: \`architecture/SS-engine-module.md\` v1.1.20 (Architect 9A commit pending) §<section>.`
- **Rationale:** PO 9B (parallel R110 Round 9B dispatch) bumps BC-INDEX v1.7 → v1.8 and PRD v1.26.7 → v1.26.8. Active cites in this VP refreshed to PO 9B targets per cross-dispatch coordination convention. `commit pending` annotations are documented forward-coordination placeholders (per VP-INDEX §Conventions — SE-17g audit-trail preservation); will resolve to concrete SHAs during R110 Round 9E SM pass after PO 9B commits land. Supersession chain preserved per append-only §References audit-trail convention.

### Change 3 — F-R110-10 MED: Documented Convention Adoption (NORMATIVE; META)

- **SE-17g audit-trail preservation convention** newly documented in `VP-INDEX.md` §Conventions section established this round (R110 Round 9C). This VP's §Trace blocks and active §References follow the documented convention: active citations clean (post-this-bump); historical SE-17f BEFORE evidence in prior §Trace blocks preserved verbatim per SE-17g.

### Change 4 — F-R110-8 HIGH (this VP): SS Architecture-Source Pin Addition for Cross-SS Symmetry (NEW; NORMATIVE)

- **Sweep-wide audit (R110 R47) revealed structural asymmetry:** SS-01 VPs (vp-001..vp-010) carry pinned `Architecture: architecture/SS-daemon-lifecycle.md v1.0.32 (commit 6e72995 …)` cites; SS-03 VPs (vp-019..vp-022) previously carried unpinned `Architecture: architecture/SS-engine-module.md §<section>` cites without version pins. This blocked uniform cross-SS staleness audits.
- **F-R110-8 closure (this VP):** active §References Architecture cite now carries `v1.1.20 (Architect 9A commit pending)` annotation per cross-dispatch coordination convention. Architect 9A R110 Round 9A keeps SS-engine-module at v1.1.20 per coordination directive (commit pending — will resolve to concrete SHA during R110 Round 9E SM pass).
- **Rationale:** Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1+5: cheapest path (leave SS-03 unpinned as "no functional impact") rejected in favor of correct path (enable future audits). Cascade-tail of F-R110-8 sweep co-located in this dispatch.

### SE-17c-d body-scope grep (NORMATIVE)

- Post-edit `grep -n "commit pending" <this-vp-file>` body-scope active §References → 0 matches (BC-INDEX v1.8 + PRD v1.26.8 + Architecture Architect 9A active placeholders all 3 resolved mid-dispatch to commits `3334fb6` (PO 9B BC + PRD) and `159d123` (Architect 9A SS keeps) upon observing parallel dispatches landed; per documented VP-INDEX §Conventions). All historical §Trace SE-17f BEFORE evidence `commit pending` matches preserved per SE-17g.
- Post-edit `grep -n "BC-INDEX.md\` v1.8" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1 match (active §References BC index line).
- Post-edit `grep -n "prd.md\` v1.26.8" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1 match (active §References PRD line).
- Post-edit `grep -n "SS-engine-module.md\` v1.1.20" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1 match (active §References Architecture line).
- Post-edit `grep -n "2026-05-18T02:30:00Z" <this-vp-file>` body scope (excluding §Trace v1.0.x narrative blocks per SE-17c-d / VP-INDEX §Conventions) → 0 matches (all R109 Round 8C timestamps corrected to `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` per F-R110-1; references inside this §Trace v1.0.x narrative are SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER evidence and excluded by convention).
- Post-edit `grep -n "2026-05-18T05:00:00Z" <this-vp-file>` body scope → many matches (frontmatter timestamp + §Trace v1.0.5 corrected timestamps + this §Trace v1.0.6 narrative).

- **Concurrent dispatches (R110 Round 9):**
  - Architect 9A: SS pin coordination (keeps v1.0.32 / v1.2.13 / v1.1.20) — separate scope.
  - PO 9B: BC + supplements + PRD + brief refresh (BC-INDEX v1.7 → v1.8; PRD v1.26.7 → v1.26.8) — separate scope.
  - FV 9C: this dispatch (22-VP cascade + VP-INDEX v1.8 — THIS file).
  - BA 9D: L2-INDEX scope — separate scope.

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` (this VP's prior §Trace v1.0.5 frontmatter timestamp post-F-R110-1 correction). SE-16d PASS (equality permitted within same dispatch window; strict-greater satisfied vs predecessor chain `2026-05-18T01:30:00Z`).

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References BC-INDEX cite refresh `v1.6 (commit 22579ac)` → `v1.8 (commit pending)` with supersession chain; §References PRD cite refresh `v1.26.6 (commit c307f2a)` → `v1.26.8 (commit pending)` with supersession chain; §References Architecture line — NEW version pin added `v1.1.20 (Architect 9A commit pending)` per F-R110-8 HIGH for cross-SS pin symmetry; §Trace v1.0.5 timestamps refreshed `2026-05-18T02:30:00Z` → `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z`; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsections; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.
- **SE-17g EXCEPTION (Change 1):** Round 8 §Trace timestamp in-place correction is a documented exception to SE-17g historical-immutability — granted because the historical timestamp carried a wrong-date defect (not a valid state-at-time-of-bump snapshot). User-directed correction per R110 FAIL Option A.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+4+5

Rule 1: mechanical timestamp correction + active cite forward refresh executed in-scope of R110 Round 9C rather than deferred. Rule 4: coupled cascade fixes consolidated into single v1.0.6 bump rather than fragmented. Rule 5: cheapest path (preserve wrong-date timestamp as "stale but acceptable") rejected in favor of correct path (correct in-place under documented SE-17g exception). PRD v1.26.8 and BC-INDEX v1.8 cites are post-PO-9B targets (commit pending — will resolve to concrete SHAs during R110 Round 9E SM pass after parallel dispatches converge). No tech-debt entries created. SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence in prior §Trace blocks preserved per SE-17g audit-trail discipline (except the F-R110-1 in-place timestamp correction per documented SE-17g exception).

## §Trace v1.0.7 — F-R111-4 HIGH: R111 Round 10 FV Fix Burst (Active Citation Cross-SS Source-Contract Pin Symmetry + SS-Pin Cascade Tail)

**Bump:** v1.0.6 → v1.0.7.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.6 (commit pending — R110 Round 9C FV cascade: §Conventions section + active cite forward refresh + SS-02/SS-03 §References Architecture-pin symmetry).

**Scope of v1.0.7 (NORMATIVE — R111 Round 10 FV fix burst per user direction Option A; small focused round; counter 0/3):**

### Change 1 — F-R111-4 HIGH: §References Source-Contract Pin Addition (sweep-wide symmetry; was unpinned at v1.0.3) (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f §References Source contract line:**
  - Before: `Source contract: \`behavioral-contracts/ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md\`.` (no version pin)
  - After: `Source contract: \`behavioral-contracts/ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md\` v1.0.3 (commit 68304e3 — PO 9B R110 Round 9B BC scope dispatch).`
- **Rationale:** F-R111-4 sweep-wide audit revealed structural asymmetry — 21 of 22 VPs carried unpinned `Source contract:` cites in active §References while vp-009 carried a pinned cite with concrete commit SHA. This blocked uniform cross-VP source-contract staleness audits (a one-liner `grep "Source contract:.* v" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` produced only 1 match). R111 Round 10 closes this gap by adding pins to all 21 unpinned VPs (and refreshing vp-009 in parallel via F-R111-3). Cross-VP source-contract pin symmetry now established at the current canonical BC version v1.0.3 (commit 68304e3 per PO 9B R110 Round 9B BC scope dispatch). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1+5: cheapest path (leave 21 VPs unpinned as "no functional impact") rejected in favor of correct path (enable future audits). Symmetric to F-R110-8 §References Architecture-pin symmetry precedent.


### SE-17c-d body-scope grep (NORMATIVE)

- Post-edit `grep -nE "BC-2.03.004\.md\` v1.0.3" <this-vp-file>` §References body scope → 1 match (active §References Source contract line, newly pinned).
- Post-edit `grep -nE "commit 68304e3" <this-vp-file>` body scope → 1+ matches (active §References Source contract line; concrete PO 9B R110 Round 9B commit SHA resolved).

### Authoritative cross-references

- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.8 (commit 3334fb6 — PO 9B R110 Round 9B BC scope dispatch).
- **Source BC (BC-2.03.004):** `behavioral-contracts/ss-03/BC-2.03.004.md` v1.0.3 (commit 68304e3 — PO 9B R110 Round 9B BC scope dispatch).
- **Architecture (SS-01):** `architecture/SS-daemon-lifecycle.md` v1.0.32 (commit 6e72995 — Architect 8A R109 Round 8A bump; Architect 9A R110 Round 9A keeps at v1.0.32 (commit 159d123)).
- **R111 closure chain:** F-R111-2 HIGH (SS-01 §Source Contract Traces-to SS pin refresh + 3-VP pin addition for intra-SS-01 symmetry) + F-R111-3 HIGH (vp-009 §References Source-contract v1.0.5 → v1.0.6 refresh) + F-R111-4 HIGH (sweep-wide §References Source-contract pin addition across 21 unpinned VPs for cross-VP symmetry). Per-VP cascade.
- **Concurrent dispatches (R111 Round 10):** FV-only fix burst per user direction (small focused round).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-18T07:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-18T05:00:00Z` (this VP's prior §Trace v1.0.6 frontmatter timestamp). SE-16d PASS (strict-greater satisfied).

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References Source-contract pin addition/refresh; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsections; cross-reference subsection.
- **SE-17g audit-trail preservation:** All prior §Trace SE-17f BEFORE evidence preserved verbatim per VP-INDEX §Conventions (established R110 Round 9C, F-R110-10 MED).

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+4+5

Rule 1: mechanical citation pin add/refresh executed in-scope of R111 Round 10 rather than deferred. Rule 4: 3 coupled cascade fixes (F-R111-2 + F-R111-3 + F-R111-4) consolidated into single v1.0.7 bump rather than fragmented across 3 separate dispatches. Rule 5: cheapest path (preserve 21-of-22 unpinned source-contract asymmetry as "advisory") rejected in favor of correct path (enable cross-VP source-contract staleness audits via sweep-wide pin symmetry). No tech-debt entries created. SE-17f BEFORE/AFTER snapshot evidence in prior §Trace blocks preserved per SE-17g audit-trail discipline.
