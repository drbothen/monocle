# VP-016: Proto Field Number 1 in `HookEnvelope` is `schema_version`

> **One-per-file:** Each verification property lives in its own file.
> Renumbered from VP-PROTO-001a (PG-5 historical) per template-compliance Dispatch 5b.

## Property Statement

In `monocle-proto/proto/monocle/v1/hook_envelope.proto`, the `HookEnvelope`
message's field assigned to proto-tag-number `1` has the field name
`schema_version` and type `uint32`. The wire-level invariant is verified
by encoding a `HookEnvelope` and decoding the first field tag.

## Source Contract

- **BC:** BC-2.02.006 — Hook Envelope Proto Field Numbers (Wire Schema).
- **Postcondition/Invariant:** BC-2.02.006 Postcondition asserting
  `schema_version = 1` proto-tag wire-format assignment in `HookEnvelope`
  message; cross-property with VP-017 (Rust surface) and VP-018
  (forward-compat dispatch structural recap).
- **Traces to (historical):** BC-PROTO-001a (SS-core-types-and-abi.md
  §Prost Wire Schemas; PRD v1.25 §BC-PROTO-001a Verification subsection).

## Proof Method

| Method | Tool | Bounded? | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Integration test (primary) | prost + prost-reflect | Bounded — single message field | Wire-tag decode of field 1; FileDescriptorSet name lookup |

## Mechanism

Integration test (harness located at
`monocle-proto/tests/wire_field_order.rs` — files in `<crate>/tests/`
are cargo integration tests; PRD v1.25 §7 RTM Test Type column labels
this BC `Unit` referring to conceptual scope, but the harness layout is
cargo-integration per file location). The harness encodes a
`HookEnvelope` via `prost::Message::encode_to_vec`, parses the first
wire-tag to confirm field number 1 with wire type `Varint`, then
inspects the FileDescriptorSet (from `prost-build`'s
`OUT_DIR/file_descriptor_set.bin` or compile-time include) to confirm
field 1 name == "schema_version".

## Pre-conditions

- `monocle-proto` build script (`build.rs`) compiles the `.proto` files
  via `prost-build`.
- `prost-reflect` or direct `prost::encoding` is available in
  `[dev-dependencies]`.

## Post-conditions

1. Encoding a `HookEnvelope { schema_version: 1, ... }` via
   `prost::Message::encode_to_vec(&envelope)` produces a byte stream
   whose first wire-tag decodes to field number 1 with wire type
   `Varint` (proto3 `uint32` = varint).
2. A `prost-build`-generated descriptor inspection (via
   `prost_reflect::DescriptorPool::decode(...)` over the
   FileDescriptorSet emitted by `build.rs`) confirms field number 1 is
   named `schema_version`.

## Counter-examples

1. The `.proto` file is edited so `schema_version = 5;` — must fail the
   wire-tag decode (the first tag would decode to field 5 instead of 1).
2. A new field `string trace_id = 1;` is inserted, displacing
   `schema_version` to a new number — must fail the field-name lookup.

## Probe Matrix

| Probe | Setup | Expected outcome |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 16.a | `HookEnvelope { schema_version: 1, ... }` encoded; parse first wire-tag | field_number == 1; wire_type == Varint |
| 16.b | Inspect FileDescriptorSet via `prost_reflect::DescriptorPool::decode` | field 1 name == "schema_version" |
| 16.c | Mutate `.proto` to renumber `schema_version = 5;` | Probe 16.a fails (first tag decodes to 5) |
| 16.d | Mutate `.proto` to insert `string trace_id = 1;` displacing `schema_version` | Probe 16.b fails (field 1 name != "schema_version") |

## Harness Location

- `monocle-proto/tests/wire_field_order.rs` (integration test)
- Test name: `test_BC_PROTO_001a_schema_version_field_number_1` (per
  PRD v1.25 §BC-PROTO-001a, Verification subsection — to be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_02_006_schema_version_field_number_1` post BC renumber
  propagation into source).

## Proof Harness Skeleton

Per L4 template §Proof Harness Skeleton: the canonical proof-harness intent for
this VP is documented across `## Mechanism` (execution narrative — what the
harness does), `## Pre-conditions` / `## Post-conditions` (assertion surface),
`## Counter-examples` (negative cases), `## Probe Matrix` (probe enumeration),
and `## Harness Location` (file path + test name). The skeleton below is the
template-strict form pointing to the rich harness specification above.

```rust
// Proof method: integration-test
// See ## Mechanism for execution narrative.
// See ## Probe Matrix for the canonical probe enumeration.
// See ## Harness Location for the implementing file and test name.
//
// Skeleton (illustrative; canonical assertions live in the probe matrix above):
#[test]  // or #[kani::proof] / proptest! / etc. per proof_method
fn verify_bc_2_02_006() {
    // Pre-conditions: see ## Pre-conditions section
    // Probe execution: see ## Probe Matrix section
    // Post-condition assertions: see ## Post-conditions section
    // Counter-example coverage: see ## Counter-examples section
}
```

**Harness implementation location:**

- `monocle-proto/tests/wire_field_order.rs` (integration test)
- Test name: `test_BC_PROTO_001a_schema_version_field_number_1` (per
  PRD v1.25 §BC-PROTO-001a, Verification subsection — to be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_02_006_schema_version_field_number_1` post BC renumber
  propagation into source).

## Feasibility Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Input space size | Bounded | Per `## Proof Method` Bounded? column above; finite probe set or bounded property quantification. |
| Proof complexity | Tractable | `proof_method: integration-test` per frontmatter; mechanism documented in `## Mechanism` section. |
| Tool support | Available | Tooling pinned in `architecture/SS-deps-pin-manifest.md`; no novel verification tooling required. |
| Estimated proof time | Within Phase-1 budget | `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter. Coverage details in `## Proof Method` table; probe enumeration in `## Probe Matrix`. |

**Authoritative feasibility verdict:** `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter (canonical machine-consumed field).

## Lifecycle

| Event | Date | Actor |
|-------|------|-------|
| Created | v1.0.0 (cycle) | vsdd-factory:architect |
| Proof harness committed | pending Phase-3 implementation | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Proof first passed | pending Phase-6 formal hardening | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Locked (VERIFIED) | pending (`verification_lock: false`) | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |

**Authoritative lifecycle state** (canonical machine-consumed fields in frontmatter):

| Field | Current Value |
|-------|---------------|
| `lifecycle_status` | `active` |
| `introduced` | `v1.0.0` |
| `verification_lock` | `false` |
| `proof_completed_date` | `null` |
| `modified` | `[]` |

## §Trace v1.0.1 — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template

**Bump:** v1.0 → v1.0.1.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0 (Dispatch 5a/5b commits 7326ff5 + e3824ec — VP monolith decomposition; Dispatch 7 commit 51e77cb — input-hash population).
**Scope of v1.0.1 (Option 3 hybrid — heading reconciliation; NO content removed):**

### Heading changes (NORMATIVE)

- **Renamed** `## Verification Method` → `## Proof Method` (template-strict per L4-verification-property-template.md §Proof Method). Content unchanged; identical Method/Tool/Bounded?/Coverage table preserved verbatim.
- **Added** `## Proof Harness Skeleton` (template-required §Proof Harness Skeleton). Section is a template-strict skeleton block that references the existing rich harness specification (`## Mechanism` for execution narrative, `## Probe Matrix` for probe enumeration, `## Harness Location` for file + test name). The L4 template's skeleton is a Rust code-block stub; monocle's pre-existing `## Mechanism` + `## Harness Location` exceed the template's stub fidelity by carrying execution narrative AND concrete file paths. The new `## Proof Harness Skeleton` section satisfies the template heading requirement without removing the richer Phase-1-specific content.
- **Added** `## Feasibility Assessment` (template-required §Feasibility Assessment). Section is a populated Factor/Assessment/Notes table derived from the `feasibility:` frontmatter field (canonical machine-consumed value) + the `## Proof Method` Bounded?/Coverage columns. The L4 template carries feasibility as both a frontmatter field and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter value.
- **Added** `## Lifecycle` (template-required §Lifecycle). Section is a populated Event/Date/Actor table + an authoritative lifecycle-state mirror of the DF-030 lifecycle frontmatter fields. The L4 template carries lifecycle as both frontmatter fields and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter values.

### Project-specific extensions retained (INFORMATIONAL rationale per SE-17g)

The monocle VP body retains the following sections beyond the L4 template's minimum set; they encode Phase-1-specific verification discipline that emerged during the cycle-001 adversarial review chain:

- `## Mechanism` — execution narrative for the proof harness. Encodes the F-R88-5 discipline of separating test-type-class (Integration/Unit/AST-audit/Proptest) from harness-execution-narrative. Without this section the harness intent reduces to a one-cell `Method` column in `## Proof Method`, which proved insufficient during R85-R87 for adversary fresh-context comprehension.
- `## Pre-conditions` — precondition surface for the harness. Required for proof-harness reproducibility per F-R89/F-R90 work.
- `## Post-conditions` — assertion surface for the harness. The numbered postcondition format (1., 2., 3., …) emerged from R88-R91 BC↔VP round-trip discipline; flat unstructured postcondition prose proved insufficient for fresh-context BC→VP traceability.
- `## Counter-examples` — negative cases. Encodes mutation-test rationale per VP-013's `## Mutation-Test Rationale` extension; even VPs without an explicit mutation block carry counter-example enumeration to make the assertion surface adversary-reviewable.
- `## Probe Matrix` — probe enumeration table. The Probe ID column (e.g., `1.a`, `14.b`, `22.c`) provides direct probe→assertion traceability for the F-R89/F-R90 probe-enumeration discipline that emerged from BC↔VP round-trip cycles. Without this section the probe set is implicit in `## Mechanism` prose, which the adversary repeatedly flagged as insufficient.
- `## Harness Location` — direct test-path traceability (file path + test name). Provides implementer + test-writer agents in Phase 3 with explicit harness implementation targets, eliminating one round-trip during TDD red-gate setup.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **L4 template:** `templates/L4-verification-property-template.md` (canonical heading set: `## Property Statement`, `## Source Contract`, `## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`).
- **Audit R1:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r1.md` (D-122 trigger — initial heading-name mismatch identification).
- **Audit R2:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r2.md` RES-03 (residual heading-name mismatch on all 22 VP files; this v1.0.1 closes RES-03).

### Concurrent dispatches

- **architect RES-01+RES-04:** COMPLETE (commit 0af206a) — input-hash normalization + ARCH-INDEX Tokens column.
- **PO RES-02+RES-05:** COMPLETE (commit 1a09095) — BC VP anchor sweep + PRD §6/§7 column reconciliation.
- **FV RES-03:** this v1.0.1 (audit R2 residual closure for all 22 VP files).

### Content preservation verification

NO content removed. Heading renames in place. New `## Proof Harness Skeleton` / `## Feasibility Assessment` / `## Lifecycle` sections are derived from existing frontmatter fields + existing body sections; they add structure without changing the authoritative machine-consumed values (which remain in frontmatter per the L4 schema).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T18:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T17:30:00Z` (PRD v1.26.1 — RES-05 concurrent dispatch). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: heading renames + new section additions (`## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`); frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: project-specific extension rationale (above subsection); audit cross-references; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Chose **Option 3 (hybrid)** — template-aligned form with documented project-specific extensions — over Option 1 (template-strict rename + reorganize, which would risk content drift on the Phase-1-emergent probe enumeration discipline) and Option 2 (extension-only documentation without template heading adoption, which would leave the audit RES-03 WARN unresolved). Option 3 satisfies the L4 template heading requirements (all 6 required headings present) AND preserves the Phase-1 verification discipline (probe matrices, mechanism narratives, harness locations) that the adversarial review chain hardened.

## §Trace v1.0.2 — F-R105-13 LOW: VP §References PRD Citation Refresh v1.26 → v1.26.3

**Bump:** v1.0.1 → v1.0.2.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.1 (commit 4090d0b — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template).
**Scope of v1.0.2 (NORMATIVE — §References PRD citation refresh; NO content cascade; NO BC-path changes — BC §References already cite canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-NN/BC-2.SS.NNN.md` paths):**

### Change set 1 — §References PRD Citation Refresh `v1.26` → `v1.26.3` (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** §References cited `prd.md v1.26 §BC-2.02.006 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65).` (pre-edit grep).
  - **After:** §References cites `prd.md v1.26.3 §BC-2.02.006 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.3 in F-R105-12 closure, parallel PO commit b2b378b).` (post-edit grep).
- **SE-17c-d body-scope grep:** post-edit `grep -n "prd.md v1.26 " vp-016-hook-envelope-proto-field-numbers.md` → 0 matches; `grep -n "prd.md v1.26.3" vp-016-hook-envelope-proto-field-numbers.md` → 1 match (§References line).
- **BC §References scope:** §References §Source contract entry already cites canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-02/BC-2.02.006.md` (per BC-INDEX.md v1.2). No BC-path changes required in this dispatch.
- **Historical PRD v1.25 citations in body prose (Source Contract `Traces to (historical)`, Harness Location `to be migrated to`, Proof Harness Skeleton `to be migrated to`, where present):** UNCHANGED — these are explicitly historical predecessor citations pinned to the pre-Dispatch-4 PRD monolith and must not be refreshed.

### Rationale

PO commit b2b378b (T-128k Round-3 PO dispatch) bumped PRD `v1.26.2 → v1.26.3` for F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure. Parallel FV dispatch refreshes VP §References to cite the post-bump PRD version, preserving the stale-citation-zero invariant established in F-R105-7 (manifest pin refresh) and F-R105-11 (sister-VP reference reconciliation). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1: no MVP-driven deferral; mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope of T-128k FV portion rather than left to post-Round-3 cleanup.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.3 (commit b2b378b — F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.2 (commit 61133a7 — confirms canonical sharded path `ss-02/BC-2.02.006.md` for BC-2.02.006).
- **R105 closure chain:** F-R105-13 LOW — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh sweep.
- **Concurrent dispatches (T-128k Round 3):**
  - PO: PRD v1.26.2 → v1.26.3 (F-R105-12 + GAP-R44-4) — COMPLETE (commit b2b378b).
  - architect: auth-header interop adjudication — separate scope.
  - BA: L2-INDEX anchor fixes — separate scope.
  - FV: this §Trace (F-R105-13 — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T20:30:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T19:30:00Z` (this VP's prior v1.0.1 §Trace and PRD v1.26.3 frontmatter). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References PRD citation `v1.26` → `v1.26.3`; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### SE-17g META audit (NORMATIVE)

Sweep-wide post-edit re-grep across all 22 VP files: `grep -rE "prd\.md v1\.(26[^.]|26\.[012])(\s|\$)" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. Sweep-wide re-grep for non-sharded BC paths: `grep -rE "behavioral-contracts/BC-[^I]" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. F-R105-13 closure verified.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope rather than deferred. PRD v1.26.3 cite is valid as of PO commit b2b378b. No tech-debt entries created. Body-prose historical PRD v1.25 citations preserved unchanged per Production-Grade discipline (historical predecessor citations are not stale; refreshing them would erase audit trail).
