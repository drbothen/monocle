# VP-013: Non-Exhaustive Enum Policy (Modulo ADR-0004 Exemptions)

> **One-per-file:** Each verification property lives in its own file.
> Renumbered from VP-TYPES-001 (PG-5 historical) per template-compliance Dispatch 5b.

## Property Statement

For every `pub enum E` defined in any source file of the `monocle-core`
crate, exactly one of the following holds:

1. `E` carries `#[non_exhaustive]`, OR
2. `E` is listed in the ADR-0004 exemption set
   `{ "Phase1Permission", "ClaudeCodeTool" }`.

No other exemption is allowed without a new ADR superseding ADR-0004.

## Source Contract

- **BC:** BC-2.02.003 — Enum Extensibility (Non-Exhaustive Default Policy).
- **Postcondition/Invariant:** BC-2.02.003 invariant 1 (every `pub enum` in
  `monocle-core` is `#[non_exhaustive]` modulo the explicit ADR-0004
  exemption set); supporting clippy lint configuration `non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns`
  deny-listed at workspace level.
- **Traces to (historical):** BC-TYPES-001 (SS-core-types-and-abi.md
  §Enum Extensibility; PRD v1.25 §BC-TYPES-001 Verification subsection).

## Proof Method

| Method | Tool | Bounded? | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| AST audit (primary) | syn 2 | Bounded — finite enum set in `monocle-core/src/**/*.rs` | All `pub enum` declarations in `monocle-core` |
| Mutation testing (auxiliary) | cargo-mutants | Bounded — mutation budget | `EXEMPT` constant length + `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute-presence check are mutation surfaces |
| Clippy lint (supplementary) | cargo clippy | N/A — static | `non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns` deny-listed for `#[allow]` (per SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md) |

## Mechanism

AST audit (primary, via a `syn 2` AST audit harness at
`monocle-core/tests/enum_audit.rs` parsing every
`monocle-core/src/**/*.rs` file and walking all `Item::Enum` nodes; per
PRD v1.25 §BC-TYPES-001 invariant 1; PRD v1.25 §7 RTM Test Type column
labels this BC `AST audit (syn 2)`); mutation-test (auxiliary); clippy
`non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns` lint configuration (supplementary).

## Pre-conditions

- `monocle-core` source tree is the audit scope.
- The exempt-list constant in the test harness is
  `EXEMPT: &[&str] = &["Phase1Permission", "ClaudeCodeTool"]`.

## Post-conditions

1. A test harness in `monocle-core/tests/enum_audit.rs` parses every
   `monocle-core/src/**/*.rs` file via `syn 2`, walks all `Item::Enum`
   nodes, and asserts that for each enum either `#[non_exhaustive]` is
   present in the attribute list OR the enum's identifier is in
   `EXEMPT`.
2. The test fails with a descriptive error listing every offending enum
   if the property is violated.
3. The `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` invocation passes with
   the project-local lint `non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns` deny-listed
   for `#[allow]` (per SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md).

## Counter-examples

1. A new contributor adds `pub enum NewError { ... }` to
   `monocle-core/src/` without `#[non_exhaustive]` and not in the
   exempt list — must fail the audit.
2. A contributor sneaks `#[allow(non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns)]` into
   a match site — must fail the clippy step (semgrep rule co-enforces,
   per SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Semgrep Rules).
3. A contributor adds `pub enum Phase2Permission` to `monocle-core/`
   (NOT in `monocle-plugin-sdk`) without `#[non_exhaustive]` and not in
   the exempt list — must fail the audit. (Even though ADR-0004
   contemplates a parallel `Phase 3` enum in the plugin SDK, that enum
   is in a different crate and the audit is `monocle-core`-scoped.)
4. Exempt list expanded silently to add a third enum without an ADR
   superseding ADR-0004 — covered by an orthogonal consistency check
   that greps for the `EXEMPT` constant length and asserts it equals
   the count of exhaustive enums documented in ADR-0004 (currently 2).

## Mutation-Test Rationale

Mutating the `EXEMPT` constant length (e.g., adding a stray entry) or
the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute presence check (e.g., flipping
`has_attr` to `!has_attr`) must be caught by the audit harness — this
is a high-leverage mutation surface. `cargo-mutants` is the auxiliary
mechanism: a mutant that flips the attribute-presence check or grows
the exempt list silently must be killed by an existing failing test.

## Probe Matrix

| Probe | Setup | Expected outcome |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| 13.a | Walk all `pub enum` in `monocle-core/src/**/*.rs` | Each is `#[non_exhaustive]` OR in EXEMPT |
| 13.b | Inject `pub enum NewError { ... }` without `#[non_exhaustive]` | Audit fails with descriptive error |
| 13.c | Inject `#[allow(non_exhaustive_omitted_patterns)]` | Clippy step fails |
| 13.d | Expand EXEMPT list silently | Consistency check fails (length mismatch with ADR-0004 documented count) |
| 13.e | cargo-mutants flips `has_attr` to `!has_attr` | Mutation killed by audit failure |

## Harness Location

- `monocle-core/tests/enum_audit.rs` (AST audit)
- Test name: `test_BC_TYPES_001_non_exhaustive_enum_coverage` (per PRD
  v1.25 §BC-TYPES-001, Verification subsection — to be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_02_003_non_exhaustive_enum_coverage` post BC renumber
  propagation into source).

## Proof Harness Skeleton

Per L4 template §Proof Harness Skeleton: the canonical proof-harness intent for
this VP is documented across `## Mechanism` (execution narrative — what the
harness does), `## Pre-conditions` / `## Post-conditions` (assertion surface),
`## Counter-examples` (negative cases), `## Probe Matrix` (probe enumeration),
and `## Harness Location` (file path + test name). The skeleton below is the
template-strict form pointing to the rich harness specification above.

```rust
// Proof method: ast-audit+mutation-test
// See ## Mechanism for execution narrative.
// See ## Probe Matrix for the canonical probe enumeration.
// See ## Harness Location for the implementing file and test name.
//
// Skeleton (illustrative; canonical assertions live in the probe matrix above):
#[test]  // or #[kani::proof] / proptest! / etc. per proof_method
fn verify_bc_2_02_003() {
    // Pre-conditions: see ## Pre-conditions section
    // Probe execution: see ## Probe Matrix section
    // Post-condition assertions: see ## Post-conditions section
    // Counter-example coverage: see ## Counter-examples section
}
```

**Harness implementation location:**

- `monocle-core/tests/enum_audit.rs` (AST audit)
- Test name: `test_BC_TYPES_001_non_exhaustive_enum_coverage` (per PRD
  v1.25 §BC-TYPES-001, Verification subsection — to be migrated to
  `test_BC_2_02_003_non_exhaustive_enum_coverage` post BC renumber
  propagation into source).

## Feasibility Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Input space size | Bounded | Per `## Proof Method` Bounded? column above; finite probe set or bounded property quantification. |
| Proof complexity | Tractable | `proof_method: ast-audit+mutation-test` per frontmatter; mechanism documented in `## Mechanism` section. |
| Tool support | Available | Tooling pinned in `architecture/SS-deps-pin-manifest.md`; no novel verification tooling required. |
| Estimated proof time | Within Phase-1 budget | `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter. Coverage details in `## Proof Method` table; probe enumeration in `## Probe Matrix`. |

**Authoritative feasibility verdict:** `feasibility: feasible` per frontmatter (canonical machine-consumed field).

## Lifecycle

| Event | Date | Actor |
|-------|------|-------|
| Created | v1.0.0 (cycle) | vsdd-factory:architect |
| Proof harness committed | pending Phase-3 implementation | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Proof first passed | pending Phase-6 formal hardening | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |
| Locked (VERIFIED) | pending (`verification_lock: false`) | vsdd-factory:formal-verifier |

**Authoritative lifecycle state** (canonical machine-consumed fields in frontmatter):

| Field | Current Value |
|-------|---------------|
| `lifecycle_status` | `active` |
| `introduced` | `v1.0.0` |
| `verification_lock` | `false` |
| `proof_completed_date` | `null` |

## §Trace v1.0.1 — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template

**Bump:** v1.0 → v1.0.1.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0 (Dispatch 5a/5b commits 7326ff5 + e3824ec — VP monolith decomposition; Dispatch 7 commit 51e77cb — input-hash population).
**Scope of v1.0.1 (Option 3 hybrid — heading reconciliation; NO content removed):**

### Heading changes (NORMATIVE)

- **Renamed** `## Verification Method` → `## Proof Method` (template-strict per L4-verification-property-template.md §Proof Method). Content unchanged; identical Method/Tool/Bounded?/Coverage table preserved verbatim.
- **Added** `## Proof Harness Skeleton` (template-required §Proof Harness Skeleton). Section is a template-strict skeleton block that references the existing rich harness specification (`## Mechanism` for execution narrative, `## Probe Matrix` for probe enumeration, `## Harness Location` for file + test name). The L4 template's skeleton is a Rust code-block stub; monocle's pre-existing `## Mechanism` + `## Harness Location` exceed the template's stub fidelity by carrying execution narrative AND concrete file paths. The new `## Proof Harness Skeleton` section satisfies the template heading requirement without removing the richer Phase-1-specific content.
- **Added** `## Feasibility Assessment` (template-required §Feasibility Assessment). Section is a populated Factor/Assessment/Notes table derived from the `feasibility:` frontmatter field (canonical machine-consumed value) + the `## Proof Method` Bounded?/Coverage columns. The L4 template carries feasibility as both a frontmatter field and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter value.
- **Added** `## Lifecycle` (template-required §Lifecycle). Section is a populated Event/Date/Actor table + an authoritative lifecycle-state mirror of the DF-030 lifecycle frontmatter fields. The L4 template carries lifecycle as both frontmatter fields and a body table; pre-v1.0.1 monocle VPs carried it only in frontmatter. v1.0.1 adds the body table without changing the authoritative frontmatter values.

### Project-specific extensions retained (INFORMATIONAL rationale per SE-17g)

The monocle VP body retains the following sections beyond the L4 template's minimum set; they encode Phase-1-specific verification discipline that emerged during the cycle-001 adversarial review chain:

- `## Mechanism` — execution narrative for the proof harness. Encodes the F-R88-5 discipline of separating test-type-class (Integration/Unit/AST-audit/Proptest) from harness-execution-narrative. Without this section the harness intent reduces to a one-cell `Method` column in `## Proof Method`, which proved insufficient during R85-R87 for adversary fresh-context comprehension.
- `## Pre-conditions` — precondition surface for the harness. Required for proof-harness reproducibility per F-R89/F-R90 work.
- `## Post-conditions` — assertion surface for the harness. The numbered postcondition format (1., 2., 3., …) emerged from R88-R91 BC↔VP round-trip discipline; flat unstructured postcondition prose proved insufficient for fresh-context BC→VP traceability.
- `## Counter-examples` — negative cases. Encodes mutation-test rationale per VP-013's `## Mutation-Test Rationale` extension; even VPs without an explicit mutation block carry counter-example enumeration to make the assertion surface adversary-reviewable.
- `## Probe Matrix` — probe enumeration table. The Probe ID column (e.g., `1.a`, `14.b`, `22.c`) provides direct probe→assertion traceability for the F-R89/F-R90 probe-enumeration discipline that emerged from BC↔VP round-trip cycles. Without this section the probe set is implicit in `## Mechanism` prose, which the adversary repeatedly flagged as insufficient.
- `## Harness Location` — direct test-path traceability (file path + test name). Provides implementer + test-writer agents in Phase 3 with explicit harness implementation targets, eliminating one round-trip during TDD red-gate setup.
- **Project-specific additional sections preserved unchanged:** ## Mutation-Test Rationale.


### Authoritative cross-references

- **L4 template:** `templates/L4-verification-property-template.md` (canonical heading set: `## Property Statement`, `## Source Contract`, `## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`).
- **Audit R1:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r1.md` (D-122 trigger — initial heading-name mismatch identification).
- **Audit R2:** `.factory/plans/template-compliance-audit-r2.md` RES-03 (residual heading-name mismatch on all 22 VP files; this v1.0.1 closes RES-03).

### Concurrent dispatches

- **architect RES-01+RES-04:** COMPLETE (commit 0af206a) — input-hash normalization + ARCH-INDEX Tokens column.
- **PO RES-02+RES-05:** COMPLETE (commit 1a09095) — BC VP anchor sweep + PRD §6/§7 column reconciliation.
- **FV RES-03:** this v1.0.1 (audit R2 residual closure for all 22 VP files).

### Content preservation verification

NO content removed. Heading renames in place. New `## Proof Harness Skeleton` / `## Feasibility Assessment` / `## Lifecycle` sections are derived from existing frontmatter fields + existing body sections; they add structure without changing the authoritative machine-consumed values (which remain in frontmatter per the L4 schema).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T18:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T17:30:00Z` (PRD v1.26.1 — RES-05 concurrent dispatch). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: heading renames + new section additions (`## Proof Method`, `## Proof Harness Skeleton`, `## Feasibility Assessment`, `## Lifecycle`); frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: project-specific extension rationale (above subsection); audit cross-references; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Chose **Option 3 (hybrid)** — template-aligned form with documented project-specific extensions — over Option 1 (template-strict rename + reorganize, which would risk content drift on the Phase-1-emergent probe enumeration discipline) and Option 2 (extension-only documentation without template heading adoption, which would leave the audit RES-03 WARN unresolved). Option 3 satisfies the L4 template heading requirements (all 6 required headings present) AND preserves the Phase-1 verification discipline (probe matrices, mechanism narratives, harness locations) that the adversarial review chain hardened.

## §Trace v1.0.2 — F-R105-13 LOW: VP §References PRD Citation Refresh v1.26 → v1.26.3

**Bump:** v1.0.1 → v1.0.2.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.1 (commit 4090d0b — Audit R2 Residual RES-03: VP Heading Reconciliation to L4 Template).
**Scope of v1.0.2 (NORMATIVE — §References PRD citation refresh; NO content cascade; NO BC-path changes — BC §References already cite canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-NN/BC-2.SS.NNN.md` paths):**

### Change set 1 — §References PRD Citation Refresh `v1.26` → `v1.26.3` (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** §References cited `prd.md v1.26 §BC-2.02.003 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65).` (pre-edit grep).
  - **After:** §References cites `prd.md v1.26.3 §BC-2.02.003 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.3 in F-R105-12 closure, parallel PO commit b2b378b).` (post-edit grep).
- **SE-17c-d body-scope grep:** post-edit `grep -n "prd.md v1.26 " vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` → 0 matches; `grep -n "prd.md v1.26.3" vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` → 1 match (§References line).
- **BC §References scope:** §References §Source contract entry already cites canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-02/BC-2.02.003.md` (per BC-INDEX.md v1.2). No BC-path changes required in this dispatch.
- **Historical PRD v1.25 citations in body prose (Source Contract `Traces to (historical)`, Harness Location `to be migrated to`, Proof Harness Skeleton `to be migrated to`, where present):** UNCHANGED — these are explicitly historical predecessor citations pinned to the pre-Dispatch-4 PRD monolith and must not be refreshed.

### Rationale

PO commit b2b378b (T-128k Round-3 PO dispatch) bumped PRD `v1.26.2 → v1.26.3` for F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure. Parallel FV dispatch refreshes VP §References to cite the post-bump PRD version, preserving the stale-citation-zero invariant established in F-R105-7 (manifest pin refresh) and F-R105-11 (sister-VP reference reconciliation). Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Rule 1: no MVP-driven deferral; mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope of T-128k FV portion rather than left to post-Round-3 cleanup.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.3 (commit b2b378b — F-R105-12 VP alias + GAP-R44-4 closure).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.2 (commit 61133a7 — confirms canonical sharded path `ss-02/BC-2.02.003.md` for BC-2.02.003).
- **R105 closure chain:** F-R105-13 LOW — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh sweep.
- **Concurrent dispatches (T-128k Round 3):**
  - PO: PRD v1.26.2 → v1.26.3 (F-R105-12 + GAP-R44-4) — COMPLETE (commit b2b378b).
  - architect: auth-header interop adjudication — separate scope.
  - BA: L2-INDEX anchor fixes — separate scope.
  - FV: this §Trace (F-R105-13 — 22-VP §References PRD citation refresh).

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T20:30:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T19:30:00Z` (this VP's prior v1.0.1 §Trace and PRD v1.26.3 frontmatter). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References PRD citation `v1.26` → `v1.26.3`; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### SE-17g META audit (NORMATIVE)

Sweep-wide post-edit re-grep across all 22 VP files: `grep -rE "prd\.md v1\.(26[^.]|26\.[012])(\s|\$)" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. Sweep-wide re-grep for non-sharded BC paths: `grep -rE "behavioral-contracts/BC-[^I]" .factory/specs/verification-properties/vp-*.md` → 0 matches. F-R105-13 closure verified.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Mechanical citation refresh executed in-scope rather than deferred. PRD v1.26.3 cite is valid as of PO commit b2b378b. No tech-debt entries created. Body-prose historical PRD v1.25 citations preserved unchanged per Production-Grade discipline (historical predecessor citations are not stale; refreshing them would erase audit trail).

---

## §Trace v1.0.3 — F-R107-4 HIGH + GAP-R46-1 HIGH + F-R107-8 (part 2): VP §References PRD Cite Refresh v1.26.3 → v1.26.5 + Active BC-INDEX Cite Addition v1.5

**Bump:** v1.0.2 → v1.0.3.
**Predecessor pin:** v1.0.2 (commits 932f4e0 / 7b8d6e8 — prior R105/R106 FV sweeps).
**Scope of v1.0.3 (NORMATIVE — mechanical §References citation refresh + active BC-INDEX cite addition; NO content cascade):**

### Change set 1 — §References PRD Citation Refresh `v1.26.3` → `v1.26.5` (NORMATIVE)

- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** §References cited `prd.md v1.26.3 §BC-2.02.003 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.3 in F-R105-12 closure, parallel PO commit b2b378b).` (pre-edit grep).
  - **After:** §References cites `prd.md v1.26.5 §BC-2.02.003 (Dispatch 4 commit 1030c65; refreshed to v1.26.5 in F-R107-3 / GAP-R46-1 closure, parallel PO 6B dispatch — commit pending; supersedes v1.26.4 commit 01af634 pre-R107 fix burst + v1.26.3 commit b2b378b F-R105-12 closure).` (post-edit grep).
- **SE-17c-d body-scope grep (active §References scope):** post-edit `grep -nE "prd\.md.* v1\.26\.[0-4]" vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` outside §Trace history blocks → 0 matches; `grep -n "prd.md\` v1.26.5" vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` outside §Trace history blocks → 1 match (§References PRD line).
- **Historical PRD citations in §Trace history blocks:** UNCHANGED per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation discipline (predecessor citations document state-at-the-time of each historical bump and must not be refreshed; refreshing them would erase audit trail).

### Change set 2 — §References Active BC-INDEX Cite Addition v1.5 (NORMATIVE)

- **Rationale for active-cite ADDITION (not §Trace history rewrite):** F-R107-8 part 2 identifies stale BC-INDEX v1.2 cites in 22 VPs' `BC §References scope` evidence text inside §Trace v1.0.3 (F-R105-13 history blocks). Per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation discipline, §Trace history blocks are append-only — they document state at the time of the bump and are immutable. The production-grade closure is to ADD an active §References BC-INDEX cite at the current v1.5 target, which makes the v1.5 cite live-authoritative and demotes the v1.2 mention in §Trace v1.0.3 to historical snapshot evidence (its correct semantic). Before this dispatch, no VP had an active BC-INDEX §References cite — the only BC-INDEX version mentions were in §Trace history. Adding the active cite closes F-R107-8 part 2 durably without violating SE-17g.
- **SE-17f before/after evidence:**
  - **Before:** active §References had no `BC index:` line (only `Source contract:` cited the sharded BC path without referencing BC-INDEX version). Pre-edit grep `grep -nE "BC-INDEX" vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` outside §Trace blocks → 0 matches.
  - **After:** active §References gained `BC index: \`behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md\` v1.5 (commit pending — PO 6A R107 Round 6A finalization; supersedes v1.4 commit bb088a2 — PO 5A R106 Round 5; supersedes v1.2 commit 61133a7 — F-R105-3 + F-R105-9 + OBS-R44-1 DI mapping closure).` Post-edit grep `grep -nE "BC-INDEX\.md.* v1\.5" vp-013-non-exhaustive-enum-policy.md` outside §Trace blocks → 1 match (§References BC index line).
- **No BC-path or BC-version changes required:** §Source contract entry already cites canonical sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-02/BC-2.02.003.md` (per BC-INDEX.md v1.5 confirmation). No BC-path edits in this dispatch.

### Rationale

R107 Round 6C (FV scope) closes three findings in coordinated parallel dispatch:

- **F-R107-4 HIGH (VP-009-specific):** VP-009 cited ADR-0005 v1.0.1 in 3 locations (§Source Contract line 89; active §References line 431; §Trace v1.0.4 Authoritative cross-references line 660). Current ADR-0005 is at v1.0.2 (frontmatter `version: "1.0.2"` confirmed at audit time; commit 03a4c57 — F-R106-14 ADR-0005 inputs path normalization + F-R106-7 F-FC-I005 fabrication removal). All 3 cites refreshed to v1.0.2 in this dispatch.
- **GAP-R46-1 HIGH (all-22-VPs):** VP-INDEX was pre-fixed in commit 01af634 (PRD pin v1.26.3 → v1.26.4 pre-R107 fix burst) but the 22 individual VP files' active §References still cited the stale v1.26.3. PO 6B is bumping PRD v1.26.4 → v1.26.5 in parallel; this FV dispatch refreshes all 22 VPs' active §References to the post-PO-6B v1.26.5 target.
- **F-R107-8 part 2 (all-22-VPs):** 22 VPs had stale BC-INDEX v1.2 mentions inside §Trace v1.0.3 history blocks. Per SE-17g audit-trail-preservation, those §Trace mentions are historical snapshots and must not be edited. The durable closure is to ADD active §References BC-INDEX cites at the current v1.5 target (post-PO-6A), making v1.5 the live-authoritative cite and demoting the v1.2 mentions in §Trace v1.0.3 to historical snapshot evidence (their correct SE-17g semantic). PO 6A is bumping BC-INDEX v1.4 → v1.5 in parallel; this FV dispatch targets the post-PO-6A v1.5 version.

Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5: mechanical citation refresh + durable cite addition executed in-scope of R107 Round 6C rather than deferred. No tech-debt entries created. Historical §Trace block citations preserved unchanged per SE-17g.

### Authoritative cross-references

- **PRD:** `.factory/specs/prd.md` v1.26.5 (commit pending — PO 6B R107 Round 6B PRD + supplements dispatch; supersedes v1.26.4 commit 01af634 pre-R107 fix burst).
- **BC-INDEX:** `behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` v1.5 (commit pending — PO 6A R107 Round 6A BC scope dispatch; supersedes v1.4 commit bb088a2 — PO 5A R106 Round 5 BC-INDEX dual-accept finalization).
- **R107 closure chain:** F-R107-4 HIGH (VP-009 ADR-0005 pin refresh — VP-009-only); GAP-R46-1 HIGH (22-VP PRD cite refresh sweep); F-R107-8 part 2 (22-VP active BC-INDEX cite addition).
- **Concurrent dispatches (R107 Round 6):**
  - PO 6A: BC + BC-INDEX scope (BC-INDEX v1.4 → v1.5) — separate scope.
  - PO 6B: PRD + supplements (PRD v1.26.4 → v1.26.5) — separate scope.
  - FV 6C: this dispatch (VP-009 ADR-0005 pin refresh + 22-VP PRD cite refresh + 22-VP BC-INDEX active cite addition + VP-INDEX cascade).
  - Architect 6D: SS-forward-compatibility scope — separate scope.
  - BA 6E: L2-INDEX scope — separate scope.

### SE-16d chain monotonicity (NORMATIVE)

UTC ISO-8601 `Z` form: `2026-05-17T23:00:00Z` >= chain high-water `2026-05-17T22:50:00Z` (VP-INDEX v1.4 timestamp; pre-R107 fix burst commit 01af634). SE-16d PASS.

### SE-17g NORMATIVE / INFORMATIONAL classification (NORMATIVE)

- NORMATIVE: §References PRD citation `v1.26.3` → `v1.26.5`; §References BC index cite ADDITION at v1.5; frontmatter `version` / `timestamp` updates.
- INFORMATIONAL: rationale subsection; cross-reference subsection; concurrent dispatch context.

### Per CLAUDE.md Production-Grade Default Rule 1+5

Mechanical citation refresh + durable cite-addition executed in-scope rather than deferred. PRD v1.26.5 cite is the post-PO-6B target (commit pending — will resolve to concrete SHA during final state-manager pass after parallel dispatches converge). BC-INDEX v1.5 cite is the post-PO-6A target (commit pending — same resolution). No tech-debt entries created. §Trace history blocks preserved unchanged per SE-17g — historical predecessor citations are not stale; refreshing them would erase audit trail.
