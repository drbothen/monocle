# Lessons Learned — Cycle 001

Per S-7.02 cycle-closing checklist. [codified] entries indicate defense layers that were
formally written into spec artifacts (SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md or similar).

---

## R47 Codifications

### [codified] PG-1 — §Schema-Fact Citation Convention (R47)

**Pattern:** Schema-fact claims (e.g., "session_id present in all 5 monocle-canonical schemas")
must cite the source document and version that was actually inspected. Claims without
attestation become stale silently as schemas evolve.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Schema-Fact Citation Convention (R47 fix burst,
commit 1cbab1e).

**Trigger:** F-R46-1 HIGH — DTU schema-citation drift across dtu-assessment.md, SS-core-types-and-abi.md,
SS-forward-compatibility.md. Root cause: schema claims made without explicit source citation.

---

### [codified] PG-2 — META Rule: Count-Verification Sweep (R47; generalized R49)

**Pattern (R47 form):** Numbered/counted lists in spec prose must be verified against actual
element counts whenever the spec is modified. Any change that adds/removes sections, rules,
or steps must trigger a count-verification grep.

**Evolved to noun-agnostic form (R49):** The META grep recipe must match any ordinal or
word-count expression (seven, five, three, etc.) near any structural element, regardless of
the specific noun used ("mechanisms", "steps", "rules", "subsections", etc.). Enumerated-noun
forms escape when new counting nouns are introduced.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Count-Verification META Rule (R47 initial,
generalized in R49 fix burst commit 07c1259).

**Trigger:** F-R46-2/3 in R46; F-R48-adv-1 refined the generalization scope.

---

### [codified] PG-3 — §Cross-Section Directional Reference Convention (R47.2; expanded R49)

**Pattern (R47.2 form):** Within §Trace prose, cross-document references must use
position-free section names (e.g., `§EngineModule`) rather than L-number pinpoints
(e.g., "line 654"). Historical L-numbers in §Trace entries are exempt (they record
what existed when the fix was made).

**Expanded scope (R49):** Scope expanded from §Trace-prose to ALL spec prose in any section.
No cross-doc L-number pinpoints permitted in main-body prose of any section; position-free
section references required everywhere.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Cross-Section Directional Reference Convention
(R47.2 commit 42b0007; §Trace sub-rule R47.3 commit 83cd93f; all-prose expansion R49
commit 07c1259).

**Trigger:** F-R48-adv-2 revealed §Trace-only scope was insufficient; main-body prose at
4 sites in SS-engine-module.md + SS-core-types-and-abi.md also used L-numbers.

---

### [codified] PG-3 §Trace-prose Sub-Rule (R47.3)

**Pattern:** §Trace entries specifically: when writing a new §Trace entry that refers to prior
versions, use "at time of this fix" + "subsequently bumped" qualifiers to distinguish historical
pinpoints from current-state claims. This prevents M-TRACE-HISTORICAL-VS-CURRENT false positives.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Trace sub-rule (commit 83cd93f).

**Trigger:** R47.3 §Trace L-pinpoint sweep revealed the need for explicit temporal qualification
language in §Trace entries.

---

## R49 Codifications

### [codified] PG-2 Generalized to Noun-Agnostic Syntactic Shape (R49)

**Pattern:** See PG-2 entry above (R47 initial + R49 generalization merged). The R49
generalization changed the grep recipe from noun-enumerated to syntactic-shape — any
ordinal/count-word in proximity to a countable structural element triggers verification.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Count-Verification META Rule (commit 07c1259).

**Trigger:** F-R48-adv-1 LOW — PG-2 used "mechanisms" (not in enumerated noun list) at L51.
Seven subsections were actually present and the count was correct, but the PG-2 grep would
have missed it if the count had drifted.

---

### [codified] PG-3 Expanded to All-Prose Scope (R49)

**Pattern:** See PG-3 entry above. The R49 expansion changed scope from §Trace-prose to
all spec prose. Already covered in the PG-3 merged entry above.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §Cross-Section Directional Reference Convention
(commit 07c1259, all-prose scope statement).

**Trigger:** F-R48-adv-2 LOW.

---

### [codified] PG-D042-BURST-SKIP Closure — D-042 Scope Codified as .factory/specs/ Recursive (R49)

**Pattern:** D-042 grep-before-version-bump rule must use `.factory/specs/` recursive scope
(not a narrower pattern). A prior burst skipped the D-042 scope verification (PG-D042-BURST-SKIP
process gap) because the scope was not formally codified. R49 fix burst closed this by explicitly
writing `.factory/specs/` as the canonical grep scope in the D-042 convention text.

**Codified in:** SS-conventions-anti-patterns.md §D-042 Scope Codification (commit 07c1259).

**Trigger:** F-R48-adv-3 LOW and the PG-D042-BURST-SKIP finding from earlier rounds. The scope
hole allowed burst-skip gaps where the recursive grep was not applied.

## Convergence Pattern Lessons

### Trajectory decay is meaningful signal

Trajectory: R44 4f, R46 3f (1H+1M+1L), R48 3f LOW only, R50 ZERO. The severity decay
from HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW-only in R48, and then to zero in R50, is the expected pattern when
defense layers are closing root-cause coverage. Novelty assessment at R50: ZERO. This is
the correct convergence signal — not just count reduction but novelty exhaustion.

### Defense layer verification requires inter-layer compatibility check

When codifying a new defense layer, explicitly check it against ALL prior layers, not just
the gap it closes. The R47 PG-2 enumerated-noun form was correct for the R46 finding but
incompatible with the next novelty probe (F-R48-adv-1). Inter-layer compatibility check
should be added to the PG codification checklist.

### [process-gap] tagging enables root-cause closing

All R48 findings were tagged [process-gap] because they were meta-layer completeness gaps
in the defense codification, not new spec content errors. This tagging allowed R49 to address
root causes (PG-2 generalization, PG-3 expansion, D-042 scope codification) rather than
surface fixes. The [process-gap] tag correctly predicted that root-cause closure would
yield a ZERO-finding R50.
