  ZERO-CONTEXT RESUME CHECKPOINT v7.96 — 2026-06-17
  PHASE-3 v1A ACTIVE — WAVE 8 TIER 2 — S-034 WORKTREE READY
  ============================================================================
  POSITION: Phase-3 TDD implementation, v1A control-center scope, Wave 8 Tier 2.
  STATUS: S-033 MERGED (PR #40 @ c7e10f2, D-332). develop @ 314326e (resume doc
  on top of c7e10f2). S-034 worktree READY at .worktrees/S-034 (branch
  story/S-034-kill-session, base 314326e, build GREEN). 10 workspace crates
  (incl. monocle-session-host). 33/51 stories done (200/311 pts).
  Human directive: CONTINUE WAVE-8 TIER-2 AUTONOMOUSLY.
  Demo default GOING FORWARD: WEBM + .tape ONLY (NO GIF).
  Branch protection: 11 required CI contexts enforced (10 ci.yml + DTU fidelity).

  READ FIRST (in order):
  1. /Users/jmagady/Dev/monocle/NEXT-SESSION-RESUME.md  <- concise entry point
  2. /Users/jmagady/Dev/monocle/CLAUDE.md               <- production-grade + routing
  3. This STATE.md (task register table below)          <- task register + history pointers

  CORPUS FACTS (post-S-033-merge, checkpoint D-333):
  Stories: 51 total / 311 pts (33 done; 17 draft v1A Waves 8-9; 1 blocked)
  New v1A: S-033..S-048 (16 stories); EPIC-08 Session Manager; EPIC-09 Embedded PTY

  prd v1.28.3 | product-brief v2.0.4 | domain-monocle-vision-synthesis v2.2.3

  NEXT-ACTION (Wave-8 Tier 2 — start with S-034):
  Dispatch stub-architect for S-034 (S-034 worktree already created and build green).
  Tier 2 parallel-eligible after S-034: S-035, S-037 (needs S-034), S-038, S-045.
  PREREQUISITE: SEC-006-CCR-URL-VALIDATION MUST be fixed before S-045 (CWE-20/93).
  S-046 waits on S-032; S-036 needs S-033+S-034+S-035; S-047 needs S-046;
  S-048 needs S-022+S-033+S-047. F-W8INT-001/002/003 parked for Wave-8 gate;
  do NOT re-raise as in-scope findings during per-story delivery.

  PER-STORY FLOW: stub-architect → test-writer → implementer → adversarial
  convergence (3 consecutive CLEAN, Step 4.5) → demo evidence (WEBM+.tape) →
  push → pr-manager all 9 steps → merge → worktree cleanup.

  CI-PARITY RULES (all 7 apply):
  1. clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings (IN worktree)
  2. python3 scripts/check_version_pins.py (POL-11) from REPO ROOT
     python3 scripts/check_structural_claims.py (POL-12) from REPO ROOT
  3. No version literals in doc-comments (POL-11 will flag)
  4. Registry atomicity: BC/SS spec bump + version-pin-registry.yaml = one atomic
     factory-artifacts commit (L-S027-004)
  5. Unique /tmp paths per story dispatch
  6. Architect = spec only; all code to implementer-in-worktree
  7. pr-manager must complete all 9 steps

  RATIFIED DECISIONS (do NOT re-litigate):
  - D-238: session-host-owns-PTY; daemon restart SURVIVES (CASE 2); NO tmux default
  - D-304: Autonomous Phase-2 dispatch; no per-burst plan-review gate
  - D-315: Pre-pivot disposition RATIFIED (32 done; 3 active kept; 0 archive)
  - D-325: Phase-2 gate APPROVED; Phase-3 v1A active
  - D-326..D-331: S-033 Rulings A–H; adversarial convergence COMPLETE (7 passes, 3 clean)
  - D-332: S-033 MERGED PR #40 @ c7e10f2
  - D-333: Wave-8 Tier-2 autonomous delivery authorized; demo WEBM+.tape-no-GIF

  - SessionState: 5 variants (Launching/Running/Detached/Terminating/Terminated)
  - Full history: cycles/cycle-001/decisions-archive.md (D-001..D-333)

  KNOWN-FLAKY TESTS (do NOT flag as new findings):

| F-W8INT-001 | pending | wave-gate/architect | n | [integration] SessionListUpdate carries Vec<EnrichedSession> (no degraded/degraded_reason); I3-009 degraded indicator never reaches TUI via wire. Requires SS-08 broadcast wire-type decision (EnrichedSession vs SessionSnapshot). Owners: S-021/S-028. Surface at Wave-8 integration gate. |
| F-W8INT-002 | pending | wave-gate/architect | n | [integration] SessionManager::session_list() (spec'd "for InitialState IPC push") is unwired from snapshot_initial_state; spawned sessions absent from InitialState on reconnect. Bridge SessionManager sessions into InitialState (reconcile with hook-driven session_registry). Owner: S-022 (BC-2.05.002). Surface at Wave-8 integration gate. |
| F-W8INT-003 | pending | wave-gate/architect | n | [integration] Two disjoint session sources (SessionManager spawn path + hook-driven session_registry) both publish full-roster SessionListUpdate with whole-roster-replace semantics (BC-2.05.003 PC-2) → mutually clobber the TUI roster. Needs unified roster source/merge. Owners: S-018/S-028/S-033. Surface at Wave-8 integration gate. |
